                    This is my Django Financials project. I spent a semester making this project in my Application Development II course. 
                    This project was a very good learning experience as I was using HTML, CSS, and Django to create a finance application.
                    This project is simple when compared to other projects yet it still is impressive for a project to be completed in a semester.
                    I do have to give credit where credit is due. To explain, most of the HTML and CSS was sourced from a tutorial series that I 
                    was following to help me get a good base for the project as I was having a hard time learning throught the provided course material.
                    Overall, this was good as it allowed me to focus more on Django than HTML and CSS.

                    This is my Battle Platformer project. This was my course project for my C# Programming class and it allowed me to see the capabilities
                    of software developed for interacting with scripts. Previously in my education, my work was more traditional programming but this course
                    allowed me to see the power of a program that interacts with scripts in many, many ways. For example, I was able to create objects and 
                    create the behaviours of these objects through scripts. Some objects you aren't even able to see, and these have the most impact.
