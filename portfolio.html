                    This is my Django Financials project. I spent a semester making this project in my Application Development II course. 
                    This project was a very good learning experience as I was using HTML, CSS, and Django to create a finance application.
                    This project is simple when compared to other projects yet it still is impressive for a project to be completed in a semester.
                    I do have to give credit where credit is due. To explain, most of the HTML and CSS was sourced from a tutorial series that I 
                    was following to help me get a good base for the project as I was having a hard time learning throught the provided course material.
                    Overall, this was good as it allowed me to focus more on Django than HTML and CSS. In terms of user experience, the users initally
                    register an account or log in. This account is stored on a SQLite database that is saved locally on the user's machine. Then,
                    the user has the option of registering expenses and income. Each expense and income that is registered is able to be seen on their
                    respective pages as well as some extra pieces, such as total spent/received and the net of the totals. Then, the users have the ability
                    to look at statistics of their money flow as well as some basic charts using the ChartJS library.

                    This is my Battle Platformer project. This was my course project for my C# Programming class and it allowed me to see the capabilities
                    of software developed for interacting with scripts. Previously in my education, my work was more traditional programming but this course
                    allowed me to see the power of a program that interacts with scripts in many, many ways. For example, I was able to create objects and 
                    create the behaviours of these objects through scripts. Some objects you aren't even able to see, and these have the most impact.
                    In terms of user experience, the players load into the game, then are able to shoot projectiles at each other. There is a power up
                    which is able to be collected, which empoweres the attack of the player that picked it up. Each player has three health and three lives.
                    Once a player reaches zero health, the player loses a life and respawns on the top platform. Once one player reaches zero lives, the game
                    is over and the players are prompted to play again or quit the application.

                    This is my Airplane Boarding Queue project from my Data Structures and Algorithms course during college. This was my final project, and 
                    I was working with a couple of my peers for this project. This project was meant to show our knowledge of the priority queue data structure 
                    that we had covered earlier in the semester. In addition to this, SQLite was used to create a database and store information about the individuals that were 
                    registering for their flight. Beyond this, modulo arithmetic was used to display these people as they boarded the plane. In terms of user experienc, the user
                    would enter their name and select their priority, then select a seat. Upon a seat being chosen, the information provided is grabbed by the program and put into 
                    a priority queue. Once the 'board all' button is pressed, all of the fliers are stored into the database as they are popped from the queue, and subsequently
                    boarded onto the plane.
