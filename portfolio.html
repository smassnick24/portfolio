                    This is my Django Financials project. I spent a semester making this project in my Application Development II course. 
                    This project was a very good learning experience as I was using HTML, CSS, and Django to create a finance application.
                    This project is simple when compared to other projects yet it still is impressive for a project to be completed in a semester.
                    I do have to give credit where credit is due. To explain, most of the HTML and CSS was sourced from a tutorial series that I 
                    was following to help me get a good base for the project as I was having a hard time learning throught the provided course material.
                    Overall, this was good as it allowed me to focus more on Django than HTML and CSS.
